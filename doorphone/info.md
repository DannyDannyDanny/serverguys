# DoorPhone info

We have a doorphone with the followibg abilities:

1. Recieve an door-bell-ring signal
2. Carry out a two-way-full duplex sound communication
3. Open door
4. Other functions (i.e mute)

The doorphone has three pins which carry power and a communication-signal to the phone.
The three pins connect to a PCB circuit board which controls various IOs:
* Microphone: In-Sound
* Speaker: Out-sound
* Button: Signal to unlock door

## Implementation

The PCB connection behind the button to open the door can be "short-circuited" to emulate a button press.

The short circuiting can be done using a relay (to avoid damaging anyhardware b/c of voltage difference).
The Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins can be used to control the relay.

## TODO list
* [ ] Check that soldering connections behind PCB board are accessible
* [ ] Check if bridging gap with wires / paperclips triggers the unlocking signal
* [ ] Bridge gap with relay + battery
* [ ] Set up SSH to raspberry pi
* [ ] Unlock door via SSH -> Bash Script -> Raspberry Pi
* [ ] Set Raspberry-Pi up with telegram
* [ ]Â Unlock door via Telegram
